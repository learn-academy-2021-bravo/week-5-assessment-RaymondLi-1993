In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.



3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: An ***object-relational mapping*** is a top layer that allows for interactions between serverside languages and the database itself. It's kind of a middleman that allows server and database to work together as fluently as possible.

3. Model validations: Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database.

4. Strong params: It provides an interface for protecting attributes from end-user assignment. This makes Action Controller parameters forbidden to be used in Active Model mass assignment until they have been explicitly enumerated.

5. API: Is a certain endpoint or website that holds large amounts of data.
